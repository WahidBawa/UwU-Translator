Boowean Awgebwa 
• Pwopositionaw cawcuwus and set theowy awe bof instances 
of an awgebwaic system cawwed a Boowean Awgebwa 
• the opewatows in set theowy awe anawogous to the 
cowwesponding opewatow in pwopositionaw cawcuwus 
• As awways thewe must be a univewsaw set U 
– Aww sets awe assumed to be subsets of U

Union 
• Definition: Wet A and B be sets. the union of the sets A 
and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set: 
• Exampwe: What is {1,2,3} ∪ {3, 4, 5}? 
• Sowution: {1,2,3,4,5}

Intewsection 
• Definition: the intewsection of sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is 
• Note if the intewsection is empty, then A and B awe said to be 
disjoint 
• Exampwe: What is {1,2,3} ∩ {3,4,5} ?

Compwement 
Definition: If A is a set, then the compwement of the A (wif 
wespect to U), denoted by Ā is the set U - A 
Ā = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} 
Exampwe: If U is the positive integews wess than 100, what is the 
compwement of {x | x > 70}

Diffewence 
• Definition: Wet A and B be sets. the diffewence of A and B, 
denoted by A – B, is the set containing the ewements of A 
that awe not in B 
A – B = {x | x ∈ A Ù x ∉ B} = A ∩`B

the Cawdinawity of the Union of Two Sets 
• Incwusion-Excwusion: |A ∪ B| = |A| + | B| − |A ∩ B| 
• Exampwe: Wet A be the maf majows in youw cwass and B be the 
CS majows. To count the numbew of students who awe eithew 
maf majows ow CS majows, add the numbew of maf majows 
and the numbew of CS majows, and subtwact the numbew of 
joint CS/maf majows.

Pwoving Set Identities 
• Diffewent ways to pwove set identities: 
1. Pwove that each set (side of the identity) is a subset of 
the othew. 
2. Use set buiwdew notation and pwopositionaw wogic. 
3. Membewship Tabwes: Vewify that ewements in the same 
combination of sets awways eithew bewong ow do not 
bewong to the same side of the identity. Use 1 to 
indicate it is in the set and a 0 to indicate that it is not.

Key Concepts in Computew Science 
Definition: A Boowean awgebwa is a set B wif two binawy 
opewations ∨ and ∧, ewements 0 and 1, and a unawy opewation ̅ 
such that fow aww x, y, and z in B: 
x ∨ 0	=	x 
x ∧	1	=	x 
x ∨	 �̅=	1 
x ∧		�̅=	0 
(x ∨ y ) ∨ z =	x ∨	(y ∨ z) 
(x ∧	y ) ∧	z		=	x ∧	(y ∧ z) 
x ∨ y =	y ∨ x 
x ∧	y =	y ∧ x 
x ∨ (y ∧ z) =	(x ∨	y) ∧ (y ∨ z) 
x ∧		(y ∨	z	) =	(x ∧	y) ∨	(y ∧ z)
