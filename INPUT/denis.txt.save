Hey it's me, we just played together. I noticed you didn't add me but I sent you a friend request hah, maybe its glitched or something. You're pretty cool though like I said before, that's why i got my team to throw for you. It's so cool to see a girl playing in gamess though. I know you have a boyfriend so I hope he treats you well. Like if I was your boyfriend I'd make you sandwiches while you play and buy you chocolate and give you back rubs and call you cool and laugh with you at all your jokes, not really though because we arn't together (at least not yet) :wink: Yeah so haha you should totally accept my friend request though so we can talk more and have fun together, just as friends of couse coz otherwise it would be weird and I don't want to get cooties from you ewwwww (just joking, I would like your cooties) :p
